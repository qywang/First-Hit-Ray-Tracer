To compile the project, you need to run the following commands:
1) use cd and ls to find the path of makefile and the cpp file
2) make -f makefile (To make a makefile)
3)./HW1 (Run the project)

Then, you will see the Menu, there are 4 choices:
1:Display an image
2:Ray tracing       
3:Shading      
4:Glazed surface and animation
As for the 4th choice:
LookAt starts at (0,0.3,1), and rotates around y axis.
LightDir is fixed as(-0.3,0.5,0.6).

If you want to try another choice, run it again buy using the 2nd command. NO need to make the makefile again.
